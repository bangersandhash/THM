Advent of Cyber 2023 Day 2

Introduction

Your task is to apply the skills learnt throughout today's task to analyse a packet capture from the AntarctiCrafts network. You will need to:

    Use Pandas to group the analyse the data in Source, Destination and Protocol.
    Apply functions such as sum, average, size and describe to this grouping.

The packet capture and the required libraries have been imported for you:

    pandas pd
    packet capture (network_traffic.csv) df

    How many packets were captured (looking at the PacketNumber)?
    What IP address sent the most amount of traffic during the packet capture?
    What was the most commonly used Protocol?

Place your code into the cells below. Make sure to submit your answers in the relevant questions at the bottom of the task on TryHackMe.
Required Code (Do Not Modify)
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df = pd.read_csv('network_traffic.csv')
df.head(5)
	PacketNumber 	Timestamp 	Source 	Destination 	Protocol
0 	1 	05:49.5 	10.10.1.7 	10.10.1.9 	HTTP
1 	2 	05:50.3 	10.10.1.10 	10.10.1.3 	TCP
2 	3 	06:10.3 	10.10.1.1 	10.10.1.2 	HTTP
3 	4 	06:10.4 	10.10.1.9 	10.10.1.3 	ICMP
4 	5 	06:10.4 	10.10.1.1 	10.10.1.7 	ICMP
Your Code Below
Selection deleted
df.count()

PacketNumber    100
Timestamp       100
Source          100
Destination     100
Protocol        100

#Question 3
# Here you can perform a groupby with Pandas size function on the Source and Destination columns
# Remember, the dataframe in this notebook is called "df" not "dataframe"
# Check the hint on TryHackMe if you are stuck.

# For example:
# dataframe.groupby(['ColumnName']).size()
df.groupby(['Source']).size()

Source
10.10.1.1      8
10.10.1.10     8
10.10.1.2     12
10.10.1.3     13
10.10.1.4     15
10.10.1.5      5
10.10.1.6     14
10.10.1.7      5
10.10.1.8      9
10.10.1.9     11
dtype: int64

#Question 4
# Here you can use Pandas value.counts on the appropriate column
# Remember, we are counting how many values there are in the Protocol column

df.groupby(['Protocol']).size()

Protocol
DNS     25
HTTP    24
ICMP    27
TCP     24
dtype: int64
