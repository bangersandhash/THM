We will use hydra to test every possible password that can be put into the system. The command to brute force the above form is:

hydra -l '' -P 3digits.txt -f -v 10.10.121.64 http-post-form "/login.php:pin=^PASS^:Access denied" -s 8000

The command above will try one password after another in the 3digits.txt file. It specifies the following:

-l '' indicates that the login name is blank as the security lock only requires a password
-P 3digits.txt specifies the password file to use
-f stops Hydra after finding a working password
-v provides verbose output and is helpful for catching errors
10.10.121.64 is the IP address of the target
http-post-form specifies the HTTP method to use
"/login.php:pin=^PASS^:Access denied" has three parts separated by :
/login.php is the page where the PIN code is submitted
pin=^PASS^ will replace ^PASS^ with values from the password list
Access denied indicates that invalid passwords will lead to a page that contains the text “Access denied”
-s 8000 indicates the port number on the target
